### AI-Based Video Summarizer Project

#### **Project Overview**
An AI-powered video summarization platform that processes uploaded videos, generates concise text summaries, enables semantic search, and extracts highlights. It uses **LangChain** for task orchestration, **vector databases** for semantic search, and integrates with **AWS S3** for file storage.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Text Summarization:**
   - Generate concise summaries of video content using AI transcription and summarization models.
   - Highlight key topics and moments within the video.

2. **Semantic Search:**
   - Enable natural language queries to find specific segments in the video.
   - Retrieve timestamps and context-based snippets.

3. **Highlights Extraction:**
   - Detect and display key sections (e.g., Q&A, transitions, speaker emphasis).

4. **Direct Upload to S3:**
   - Users upload videos directly to an S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs.

5. **Event-Driven Processing:**
   - Generate events for a Python worker to process uploaded files asynchronously.

6. **Interactive Frontend:**
   - Provide an intuitive UI for users to upload videos, view summaries, and perform searches.

### **Tech Stack**

#### **Frontend (Next.js):**
- Framework: Next.js (React-based).
- UI Libraries: TailwindCSS or Material-UI.
- Video Player: Video.js or Plyr.
- File Upload: AWS S3 pre-signed URLs.

#### **Backend (Python):**
- Framework: FastAPI or Flask.
- Task Orchestration: LangChain.
- Queue System: RabbitMQ or AWS SQS.
- AI Models: Whisper for transcription, GPT-4 for summarization, and CLIP for highlight detection.

#### **Database & Storage:**
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone or Qdrant (for embeddings and semantic search).
- **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL (for metadata, summaries, and timestamps).
- **Object Storage:** AWS S3 (for videos, transcripts, and processed outputs).

---

### **Workflow**

#### **Frontend:**
1. Users upload a video file through the interface.
2. The frontend generates a pre-signed URL for secure direct uploads to S3.
3. Once the upload is complete, an event is sent to the backend queue with metadata (e.g., file name, user ID).

#### **Backend Worker:**
1. Listens for file upload events from RabbitMQ or AWS SQS.
2. Downloads the video from S3 and processes it:
   - **Transcription:** Uses Whisper or AWS Transcribe to convert audio to text.
   - **Summarization:** Uses GPT-based models via LangChain to create concise summaries.
   - **Highlight Detection:** Utilizes CLIP embeddings for identifying key video moments.
3. Stores processed data in the vector database (for semantic search) and relational database (for metadata).

#### **Semantic Search API:**
1. The backend provides an endpoint to perform semantic search using vector embeddings stored in the database.
2. Queries are matched against embeddings, and results (timestamps, transcripts) are returned to the frontend.

#### **Frontend Display:**
1. Displays the summarized content and search results.
2. Enables users to jump to specific video timestamps using interactive summaries.

### **AI Models**

#### **Transcription:**
- **Model:** OpenAI Whisper, AWS Transcribe, or AssemblyAI.
- **Purpose:** Converts video/audio to text for further processing.

#### **Summarization:**
- **Model:** OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face models (e.g., BART, T5).
- **Purpose:** Summarizes transcriptions into concise, readable formats.

#### **Highlight Detection:**
- **Model:** OpenAI CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining).
- **Purpose:** Identifies key moments in the video by analyzing scenes and captions.

#### **Embeddings for Search:**
- **Model:** OpenAI Embeddings (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) or SentenceTransformers (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Purpose:** Converts transcripts into vector embeddings for semantic search.

---

### **Vector Database Options**
- **Pinecone:** Fully managed, high-performance vector database.
- **Qdrant:** Open-source alternative with semantic search capabilities.
- **Weaviate:** Feature-rich vector database supporting hybrid search.

---
